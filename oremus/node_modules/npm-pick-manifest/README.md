[`npm-pick-manifest`](https://github.com/npm/npm-pick-manifest) is a standalone
implementation of [npm](https://npmjs.com)'s semver range resolution algorithm.

## Install

`$ npm install --save npm-pick-manifest`

### Example

```javascript
const pickManifest = require('npm-pick-manifest')

fetch('https://registry.npmjs.org/npm-pick-manifest').then(res => {
  return res.json()
}).then(packument => {
  return pickManifest(packument, '^1.0.0')
}) // get same manifest as npm would get if you `npm i npm-pick-manifest@^1.0.0`
```

### Features

* Uses npm's exact [semver resolution algorithm](http://npm.im/semver).
* Supports ranges, tags, and versions.
* Prefers non-deprecated versions to deprecated versions.
* Prefers versions whose `engines` requirements are satisfied over those
  that will raise a warning or error at install time.

### API

#### <a name="pick-manifest"></a> `> pickManifest(packument, selector, [opts]) -> manifest`

Returns the manifest that best matches `selector`, or throws an error.

Packuments are anything returned by metadata URLs from the npm registry. That
is, they're objects with the following shape (only fields used by
`npm-pick-manifest` included):

```javascript
{
  name: 'some-package',
  'dist-tags': {
    foo: '1.0.1'
  },
  versions: {
    '1.0.0': { version: '1.0.0' },
    '1.0.1': { version: '1.0.1' },
    '1.0.2': { version: '1.0.2' },
    '2.0.0': { version: '2.0.0' }
  }
}
```

The algorithm will follow npm's algorithm for semver resolution, and only
`tag`, `range`, and `version` selectors are supported.

The function will throw `ETARGET` if there was no matching manifest, and
`ENOVERSIONS` if the packument object has no valid versions in `versions`.
If the only matching manifest is included in a `policyRestrictions` section
of the packument, then an `E403` is raised.

#### <a name="pick-manifest-options"></a> Options

All options are optional.

* `includeStaged` - Boolean, default `false`.  Include manifests in the
  `stagedVersions.versions` set, to support installing [staged
  packages](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/92) when appropriate.  Note
  that staged packages are always treated as lower priority than actual
  publishes, even when `includeStaged` is set.
* `defaultTag` - String, default `'latest'`.  The default `dist-tag` to
  install when no specifier is provided.  Note that the version indicated
  by this specifier will be given top priority if it matches a supplied
  semver range.
* `before` - String, Date, or Number, default `null`. This is passed to
  `new Date()`, so anything that works there will be valid.  Do not
  consider _any_ manifests that were published after the date indicated.
  Note that this is only relevant when the packument includes a `time`
  field listing the publish date of all the packages.
* `nodeVersion` - String, default `process.version`.  The Node.js version
  to use when checking manifests for `engines` requirement satisfaction.
* `npmVersion` - String, default `null`.  The npm version to use when
  checking manifest for `engines` requirement satisfaction.  (If `null`,
  then this particular check is skipped.)
* `avoid` - String, default `null`.  A SemVer range of
  versions that should be avoided.  An avoided version MAY be selected if
  there is no other option, so when using this for version selection ensure
  that you check the result against the range to see if there was no
  alternative available.
* `avoidStrict` Boolean, default `false`.  If set to true, then
  `pickManifest` will never return a version in the `avoid` range.  If the
  only available version in the `wanted` range is a version that should be
  avoided, then it will return a version _outside_ the `wanted` range,
  preferring to do so without making a SemVer-major jump, if possible.  If
  there are no versions outside the `avoid` range, then throw an
  `ETARGET` error.  It does this by calling pickManifest first with the
  `wanted` range, then with a `^` affixed
